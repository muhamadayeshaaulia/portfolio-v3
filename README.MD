## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/muhamadayeshaaulia/portfolio-v3.git](https://github.com/muhamadayeshaaulia/portfolio-v3.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd portfolio-v3
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies (if any):**
    If your project uses Node.js and has a `package.json` file (e.g., for SCSS compilation or other build tools), you'll need to install dependencies. If not, you can skip this step.

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```


Usage
To view the portfolio locally, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

Bash

open index.html
If you have a local server setup (e.g., using Live Server in VS Code), you can serve the project through that for easier development and live reloading.

Customization
This portfolio is designed to be easily customizable. Here's how you can make it your own:

Content:

Edit index.html to update your personal information, project details, skills, and contact information.
Look for comments in the HTML to guide you on which sections to modify.
Styling:

The main styling is located in the assets/css (or assets/scss if you're using SCSS) directory.
Modify variables (if present) or directly edit the CSS rules to change colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual aspects.
If using SCSS, remember to compile your SCSS files to CSS after making changes.
Images:

Replace placeholder images in the assets/img directory with your own project screenshots, profile picture, or other relevant visuals.
